We envision Tracer to be capable of supporting efficient memory management libraries which would be wrapped around it. Tracer provides accurate memory access pattern to the application developer. This information could be used in offline and online memory management models.

\subsection{Online Memory Management Model}
The online memory model design would involve a dynamic memory manager (similar to a Java Run Time) which would move objects and pack objects with similar access patterns together in same pages.  The dynamic memory management system built would be built on top of Tracer. The caching system used in SSDAlloc is able to change the location of objects owing to its {\emph{"Object Per Page Model"}}. However, such a design increases TLB pressure. In keeping with our model of simplicity in implementation and a focus on user space solutions, we would prefer to take a different path. However, moving objects in the virtual memory requires updating any pointers to those objects, and as such would require backlinks unless application semantics were significantly restricted. As such, we expect that the dynamic memory management implementation would make user of programmer's cooperation, in a manner akin to cooperative multithreading. Here, applications would indicate when they were in a state that would guarantee that object pointers are currently not being accessed. This would activate our memory management system, freezing the application until suitable objects were relocated.

\subsection{Offline Memory Management Model}
In the offline memory management model, the application developer can run benchmarks on application design. Tracer would provide fine grained access information. The developer could then enhance the application's performance by adequately restructuring application's memory usage (by allocating frequently accessed objects together).

\paragraph{Improvement in interceptor's capabilities}
The first of these would be increasing the capability of the interceptor's parsing abilities. At the moment, the subset of C which the parser supports focuses on structs and simple C syntax, but in order to support more idiomatic C, more features would have to be added. Primary amongst these is support for arrays. Since, individual structural units within an array represent related semantic information, it may be useful to have them packed together as a single unit. Such a design model would be compatible with pointer arithmetics within arrays too.
