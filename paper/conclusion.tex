\paragraph{}
This paper presents Tracer, an instrumentation based lightweight, transparent memory tracing mechanism for C applications. This technique instruments object accesses with additional library calls, augments object structures with headers transparently and provides interfaces to application developers for getting useful information about memory access patterns. We also implement protection based mechanism based on SSDAlloc \cite{SSDAlloc} and perform microbenchmark studies using binary trees. Our implementation of a prototype of Tracer shows reasonable overheads of $28\%$ and $40\%$ over non-modified C code for creation and read heavy workloads, respectivley. In comparison to page protection mechanism, Tracer improves the average performance by $12\%$ and $6.28\%$ for read and update heavy workloads, respectively.
