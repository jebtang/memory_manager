\begin{abstract}
High performance applications such as {\emph{in-memory key-value stores, web server accelerators, etc.}} require large amounts of memory. However, these applications have heavy tailed memory access footprints. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of Tracer: a tool that allows developers to trace memory accesses at object level granularity. The design philosophy of Tracer is to assist applications in identifying {\emph{entities}} (such as C level {\emph{structures}}) which get heavily accessed. Tracer accomplishes this with negligible intrusion into the application code, allowing for easy integration with existing projects. We evaluated a prototype implementation of Tracer and observed reasonable overheads of $28\%$ and $40\%$ over non-modified C code for creation and read heavy workloads, respectively. As compared to a page protection mechanism, Tracer improves the average performance by $12\%$ and $6.28\%$ for read and update heavy workloads, respectively.
