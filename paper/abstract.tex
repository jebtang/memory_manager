\begin{abstract}
We present the design and implementation of a {\emph{Tracer}} (memory tracer) for tracing fine grained memory accesses by applications. {\emph{Tracer}} is a tool which monitors object level access patterns of applications with negligible intrusion into the application code. Memory intensive applications such as {\emph{memcache, web server accelerators, etc.}} require large amounts of memory. However, such applications have highly skewed memory access footprint. The design philosophy of {\emph{Tracer}} is to assist such applications in identifying {\emph{entities}} (such as C level {\emph{structures}}) which get heavily accessed. This work presents an experimental study of {\emph{Tracer}}.
